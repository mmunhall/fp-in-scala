Exercise 8.1
------------

_...come up with properties that specify the implementation of a sum: `List[Int] => Int` function..._

1. Reversing a list and summing it should give the same result as summing the original, nonreversed list.
2. Changing the order of the list in any way should give the same result as summing the original list.
3. If all the elements are the same value then the sum should be the product of the first element and the length of the list.
4. The sum of an empty list should be 0.
