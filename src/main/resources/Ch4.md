Chapter 3 Notes
===============

* Implementing the functions for 4.1 was easy when pattern matching. I struggled when converting my pattern matching functions to non-pattern matching functions. I had to cheat a bit and glance at the solutions. Even after figuring out the solutions, it still DID not feel natural or intuitive, and that's frustrating. Even when reviewing the functions I still have to concentrate to figure out what they're doing.
* There seems to be info missing in order to work on exercise 4.2?
* 4.2 was challenging. First, implement mean(). I used the standard Scala List collection so I could get the sum and length of a List[Double]. Then, implement variance() in steps (using vals) for each part of the algorithm. Finally, Piece each part together using flatMap.
