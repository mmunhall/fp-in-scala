Chapter 5 Notes
===============

* non-strictness ~= laziness
* non-strict function takes its arguments by name rather than by value.
* thunk == unevaluated form of an expression
* lazy keyword delays evaluation until the result is needed, then caches the result so evaluation happens only once.
* stream ~= lazy list
